# fasthtml hello world

[Demo](https://fasthtml-hello-world.vercel.app/)

[fasthtml info](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml)

Requires env variable called `SESSKEY` with [any UUID4 as value](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)

## Notes

- Kind of works out of the box
- I needed to generate a `.sesskey` file since the lazy generation fails with a read-only file-system but you also want the same key across all functions.
